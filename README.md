- 👋 Hi, I’m @kudzd
- 👀 I’m interested in payment card systems and how to make use of all the data that is collected when transactions are being processed.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Data Analytics with ALX-T and Udacity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve behavioural analytics of transaction/payment data to reduce fraud.
- 📫 You can reach me on dzimbakudzi@gmail.com
